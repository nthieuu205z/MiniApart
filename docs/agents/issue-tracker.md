# Issue tracker: Local Markdown

Issues and specs for this repo live as markdown files in `.scratch/`.

## Conventions

- One feature per directory: `.scratch/<feature-slug>/`
- The spec is `.scratch/<feature-slug>/spec.md`
- Implementation issues are one file per ticket at `.scratch/<feature-slug>/issues/<NN>-<slug>.md`, numbered from `01`, never a single combined tickets file
- Triage state is recorded as a `Status:` line near the top of each issue file (see `triage-labels.md` for the role strings)
- Comments and conversation history append to the bottom of the file under a `## Comments` heading

## When a skill says "publish to the issue tracker"

Create a new file under `.scratch/<feature-slug>/` (creating the directory if needed).

## When a skill says "fetch the relevant ticket"

Read the file at the referenced path. The user will normally pass the path or the issue number directly.

## Wayfinding operations

Used by `/wayfinder`. The **map** is a file with one **child** file per ticket.

- **Map**: `.scratch/<effort>/map.md` (the Notes / Decisions-so-far / Fog body).
- **Child ticket**: `.scratch/<effort>/issues/NN-<slug>.md`, numbered from `01`, with the question in the body. A `Type:` line records the ticket type (`research`/`prototype`/`grilling`/`task`); a `Status:` line records `claimed`/`resolved`.
- **Blocking**: a `Blocked by: NN, NN` line near the top. A ticket is unblocked when every file it lists is `resolved`.
- **Frontier**: scan `.scratch/<effort>/issues/` for files that are open, unblocked, and unclaimed; first by number wins.
- **Claim**: set `Status: claimed` and save before any work.
- **Resolve**: append the answer under an `## Answer` heading, set `Status: resolved`, then append a context pointer (gist + link) to the map's Decisions-so-far in `map.md`.

## Project-specific notes (PRJ1-CCM)

- `.scratch/` is **committed to git**, not ignored. The tickets are part of the deliverable: the lecturer follows progress by reading them in the repo, and the same files appear in every mirror of the repo when pushed.
- Feature slugs follow the vertical slices in `Doc/PRJ1_Ke-hoach-trien-khai.md`: `slice-00-nen-mong`, `slice-01-danh-muc`, … `slice-12-con-thoi-gian`.
- Every ticket title and body carries the requirement code it serves (`FR-AUT-01`, `BR-15`, `CR-008`). This is Principle 3 of the plan: no functionality that cannot be traced back to a coded requirement.
- Ticket bodies are written in Vietnamese, matching the report. Code, identifiers, and commit messages are in English.
